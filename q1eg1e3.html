                <h1>EMPATHIZE</h1>
                <p>- Many people are affected by the corona virus spread, people needs info about how prevent it from spreading.</p>
                <h1>DEFINE</h1>
                <p>- With the current implementation of face to face classes in the Philippines the cases of coronavirus could potentially go up the scale. Without having any prior knowledge about safety guidelines, students and school staffs might put themselves in great risk of spreading/ catching the virus.</p>
                <h1>IDEATE</h1>
                <p>- Avoid being in closer range and crowds. When physical separation is not attainable and in places with inadequate ventilation, wear a mask that is correctly fitting. Use soap and water or an alcohol-based hand massage to routinely wash your hands. When you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or a bent elbow. </p>
                <h1>PROTOTYPE</h1>
                <p>- The idea is that we will encourage the implementation of social distancing, paired up with the proper hygiene care before and after going out of our houses. To support it fully, we will explain and present it during a live stream where people can watch and ask questions so that they can understand it more.</p>
                <h1>TEST</h1>
                <p>- As a streamer, our plan is to conduct it via live streaming with 2 cameras, one for YouTube live and the other for Facebook live. We chose these 2 because we think they will produce more views and interest than any other streaming platforms. In the live stream, we will explain all the terms and information we have gathered throughout the process of preventing the spread of Covid-19.</p>
